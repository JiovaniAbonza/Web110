            <p>I find it very interesting on how such works, for example bulding a webpage sounds really awesome to me.</p>
            <p>I also think that coding can improve your ability on acually seeing what is going inside the code.</p>
            <p>Also coding is very powerful its what websites are made from. The internet is all based on coding.</p>

            <p>I find that there is lots of opportunity to high paying jobs and aren't as stressful.</p>
            <p>Also I have heard that there is a lot of different postions that you can go for if such doesn't met you specfic requirements. Also certain jobs give perks that in some cases make a big difference.</p>
